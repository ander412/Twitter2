On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __4__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines (e.g. it contains extraneous code from the example program that has not been removed) or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically: should have name, email, etc at top of program. Should also be written in Python 2.7, not 3.4.

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards

Suggestions for improving the code:
